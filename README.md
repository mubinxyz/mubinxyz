ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a passionate backend developer with a knack for crafting robust and scalable web applications. My toolkit includes **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Puppeteer** for server-side magic, while **MongoDB**, **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL** are my go-to databases for storing and retrieving data with finesse.

I also dabble in bot development with **Telegraf.js** and have a solid understanding of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, ensuring that my backend solutions are complemented with a touch of frontend elegance.

Whether it's building APIs, automating tasks, or integrating databases, I'm all about creating seamless experiences. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
